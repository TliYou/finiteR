Description: finiteR is a collection of functions for finite element analysis of simple structures.
    Developed mainly for educational (and possibly research) purpose, femr include functions
    to deal with the following basic elements:
    Spring element
    Linear bar elements
    Quadratic bar elements
    Plane truss element
    Space truss element
    Plane frame element
    Space frame element
    2D triangular element for plane stress/plane strain problems
    2D triangular element for axisymmetric problems
    Bar element for thermal stress analysis
    Truss element for thermal stress analysis
    Bar element for vibration analysis
    Truss element for vribration analysis
    Beam element for vibration analysis
